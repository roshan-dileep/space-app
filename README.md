# Document Processing with LangChain and Chroma

This project processes and stores documents in a **Chroma vector database** for semantic search and retrieval tasks using **LangChain** and **OpenAI embeddings**. It integrates local files and web content, splitting text into manageable chunks for efficient vector search operations.

## Features

- **Load and Process Documents**: Supports local `.md` files and web URLs as document sources.
- **Text Splitting**: Uses recursive splitting for efficient chunking and indexing.
- **Vector Embedding Generation**: Converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors using OpenAI embeddings.
- **Chroma Database**: Stores vector embeddings for persistence and fast similarity search.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-chroma-vectorstore.git
   cd document-chroma-vectorstore
